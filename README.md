Bioinformatics-Project
======================

A work in progress by Bryn and Jennifer for Professor Amarda Shehu.

Currently we're working on parsing files from the PDB and their corresponding DSSP files in order to make statements about the motifs in their secondary structure.

The following files:

AtomToResidue.java
ResidueToSS.java
SSToSmotif.java

Have not been completely compiled due to Bryn not having the capabilities to add a custom library to her classpath *sigh* Yeah, I know that makes me a bad computer scientist. Either way, these call for Jennifer's expertise.
