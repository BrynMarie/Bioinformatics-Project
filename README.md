Bioinformatics-Project
======================

A work in progress by Bryn and Jennifer for Professor Amarda Shehu.

Currently we're working on parsing files from the PDB and their corresponding DSSP files in order to make statements about the motifs in their secondary structure.

All of the files currently compile and we're working on ensuring correctness.
