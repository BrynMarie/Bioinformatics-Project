======================

A work in progress by Bryn and Jennifer for Professor Amarda Shehu.

Currently we're working on parsing files from the PDB and their corresponding DSSP files in order to make statements about the motifs in their secondary structure.

At this point, I have ensured that the following files compile:

Atom.java
AtomComparator.java
AnalyzeOneProtein.java
CartesianCoord.java
CalcGeo.java
Residue.java
ResidueComparator.java
SecondaryStructure.java
Smotifs.java

The following classes have been deprecated:

ABEnum.java

To Be Compiled:

ParseFiles.java
AtomToResidue.java
ResidueToSS.java
SSToSmotif.java
